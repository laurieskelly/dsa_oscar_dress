This interface uses d3.js and bootstrap to visually present the designers worn by actresses on the red carpet at the Academy Awards. We use circles to represent the last 11 years of Oscar nominees in the two major female categories, Best Actress in a Leading Role and Best Supporting Actress. 

Hover or click to see the information for each actress and the designer she wore. The area graph at the bottom updates to show counts for the designer in a larger sample of women. Click on one or more designers in the scrollable index on the right to highlight and compare different designers.
