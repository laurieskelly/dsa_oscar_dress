#Oscar Dress

@bo-peng and I made a visualization with d3.js and bootstrap for the [datascope blog](http://www.datascopeanalytics.com/what-we-think/2014/03/03/dresses-at-the-oscars).

We used circles to represent the last 11 years of Oscar nominees in the two major female categories, Best Actress in a Leading Role and Best Supporting Actress. 
Bo did some cool analyses on the data, as well.
